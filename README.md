# Logistic Regression Project

### Business Understanding:
Term deposits allow banks to hold money for an specific amount of time, which allows the bank to use that money for better investments. The marketing campaigns for this product were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to know if the term deposit would be or not subscribed.

### Problem Description:
Portuguese bank is having a decrease in its revenue so they want to be able to identify existing clients that have a higher chance to subscribe a term deposit. This will allow the bank to focus marketing efforts on those clients and avoid wasting money and time on clients that will probably not subscribe, as they want to increase their revenue.

#### To approach this problem we will create a classification algorithm that helps predict if a client will subscribe or not a term deposit.
